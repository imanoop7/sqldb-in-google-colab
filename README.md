# Running SQL DB in Google Colab

Welcome to the **sqldb-in-google-colab** repository! In this project, we explore how to set up and run an SQL database within Google Colab. Whether you're working on data analysis, machine learning, or any other task that involves SQL, this guide will help you get started.

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by the article: [MySQL in Google Colab: A Seamless Integration](https://drlee.io/mysql-in-google-colab-a-seamless-integration-ab4bd47c419d). We adapt the concepts to create a similar experience for other SQL databases.
